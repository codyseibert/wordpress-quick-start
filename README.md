# Wordpress Docker Quick Start

The following repo is for hosting wordpress application on a ubuntu 20.04 virtual machine. I have successfully ran this script on a digital ocean droplet, but I assume this setup.sh script could be modified or used on any potential ubuntu VM host.

# Instructions

1. create a ubuntu 20.04 Digital Ocean droplet.
2. ssh into your droplet, i.e. `ssh root@127.127.127.127`
3. setup an A record which points your domain to the IP of your droplet (A blog.thewebdevjunkie.com => 127.127.127.127)
4. clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/codyseibert/wordpress-quick-start.git`
5. cd into the directory `cd wordpress-quick-start`
6. modify `.env` to replace your secret passwords. You can generate  [secure passwords](https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenSSL) using the following command      
``` bash
openssl rand -base64 30
```
7. modify `Caddyfile` to have the domain or subdomain you expect to host your wordpress site
8. run the setup script: `./setup.sh`
9. load up a web browser to your domain (it might take a minute to host the database, wordpress, and Caddy, so give it some time)

## Credits

I followed the following documentation to figure out most of the necessary docker / caddy setup.

## Useful Tips

If you make changes to your docker-compose.yml file, you may need to rebuild / restart your services using the following command

`docker-compose up -d --build`
